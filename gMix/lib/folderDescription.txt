This folder ("./lib/") contains 3rd party libraries (jar files) needed by the 
framework components. Note that this folder can be empty if an IDE with Apache 
Ivy support is used (see "./ivy.xml").
The ant script "./lib/build.xml" can be used to download all required libraries 
if NO IDE or an IDE WITHOUT Ivy support is used.
