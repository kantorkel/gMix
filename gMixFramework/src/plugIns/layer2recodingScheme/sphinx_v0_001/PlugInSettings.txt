# NUMBER_OF_THREADS
# The number of Threads to perform the mixing process in parallel. Can increase 
# mix performance on multi-core/multi-CPU systems. Should be set to the number 
# of available cores/CPUs, or slightly lower (Note: A higher value will 
# decrease performance).
# Note: "-1" means automatic detection (Sets "NUMBER_OF_THREADS" to the number 
# of processors available to the JVM running this mix).
# Default value: -1
